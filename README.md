FEDn-PoisonAttack
=============
A systematic implementation of model poisoning attacks in federated machine learning using FEDn framework.

Core Features
=============

-  **Scalable.** The implementation leverages the core capabilities of FEDn framework. Making it highly scalable and resilient to failures.
   
-  **ML-framework agnostic**. The attacks implemented do not rely on any particular
    ML framework which is another feature made possible because of FEDn framework.

-  **Fast deployments**. This poison attack framework provides a quick and easy way
   to setup new attack scenarios and to test defense mechanism with minimal changes.

-  **Geo-distributed**. Using FEDn architecture allows the users to deploy realistic
   and geo-distributed federated experiments and emulate specific attack scenarios.
